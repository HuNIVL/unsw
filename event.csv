For Pluta, the idea that the term itself could be a hoax and that fictional items might reside in a volume of perceived knowledge is a way of grappling with concepts of authenticity, knowledge-making, photographic representation and the mediation of scientific artefacts through art. Pluta's engagement with specific sites and collected ephemera tries to undermine the very nature of such knowledge structures and image-making driven by pursuits to understand phenomena and natural forces.

Encouraging her students to “start at the point of zero”, she advocated for practitioners to rethink the fundamentals of textiles and then test their boundaries—her approaches to materiality continue to influence practitioners today. This one-day symposium brings together practitioners and thinkers to explore the vast potentials of fibre and textiles as both a material and subject in contemporary practice. The program features a keynote presentation from Antonia Syme AM, Director, Australian Tapestry Workshop, alongside a series of conversations with exhibiting artists, curators, and guest speakers.

The motivation behind this catalogue and the exhibition it accompanies is to generate a rallying point or focus for the celebration of a reunion.

It is not so much the institution itself being celebrated, though due credit must be given its central role - but rather the community of interests that grew out of it or, in some cases, in spite of it. Its About Time did not set out to be a comprehensive document of late 1970s art school but rather a wide ranging reminiscence that sought to be inclusive instead of exclusive.
