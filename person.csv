UNSW_TVFH_P_0003,"Katthy Cavaliere was an Italian born Australian artist known for her performances and installations. Her work sought to understand herself and the world around her using everyday objects, particularly those from her childhood. Her belongings and those of her family, including toys, photographs and objects, formed the basis of much of her work, which she obsessively stored, collated and documented. In her photographs, videos, and performances, Cavaliere poignantly reflected on life and human connection, and consistently strove for an authenticity of experience, memory, and history through her work.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0010,"Janet Laurence’s immersive and transformative artworks evoke a deep curiosity and empathy for the natural world. With alchemical resonances, her paintings, installations and sculptures are tactile, amorphous, and fluid. Her work is underpinned by a philosophical understanding of elemental forces connecting all living things.

She has often worked with social and natural history collections and archivally sourced images to reveal the structures of power and privilege that have shaped contemporary society.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0013,"Hayley Millar-Baker’s photographic practice examines the ongoing effects of colonisation through the lens of her family history. She uses digital photographic techniques to carefully construct a place which evades a singular historical reference point, simultaneously encompassing the past, present and future. Millar-Baker’s conflicting visual cues create a space of provocative tension which challenges the racial politics and colonial history of Australia and propose an alternative history which affirms the continuation of Indigenous culture.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0014,"Kayi Kayi Nampitjinpa is one of an extraordinary group of women artists from the Western Desert who began painting in the 1990s. The Western Desert art movement began with the establishment of the Papunya Tula Artist Cooperative in 1972 at the small community of Papunya, 240km north-west of Alice Springs. While women were excluded from Papunya Tula in the early years, in the 1980s they began assisting their husbands and male relatives on their canvasses, and by the 1990s were painting their own ceremonial stories and recognised as important artists.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0015,"In their suggestion of movement and organic growth, Bronwyn Oliver’s sculptures evoke the vitality of living forms. Her works appear to twist and curve, the intricate web of their construction carrying this movement across their surface. Regarded as one of Australia’s most significant sculptors, Oliver’s works can be elusive and contradictory, at once transparent and refined yet asserting their physicality and command of space.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0016,"Ada Bird Petyarre (also known as Petyarr) was one of a group of women, including most notably Emily Kame Kngwarreye, from the Utopia region in the Central Desert who were the first Indigenous women to gain prominence as artists. Utopia is a grouping of small communities in the Simpson Desert approximately 230 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs. In the late 1970s, women from Utopia were introduced to batik and other textile techniques as a means to establish a source of income. There is a strong tradition of ceremonial mark making in sand and on the body in this region and the women from Utopia transferred these designs onto batik, the new medium allowing a greater range of colour and a freedom and fluidity of line. Later, when these artists began to paint on canvas with acrylic paint, they created a distinctive style of painting which differed from other desert art and marked a new and important form of women’s cultural expression.

UNSW_TVFH_P_0019,"Louise Tuckwell is a Sydney-based abstract artist who works in both painting and textiles. Her works explore relationships of geometric forms and sophisticated colour combinations to create spaces of contemplation and reflection: ‘I am always aware of the ‘Golden mean’, the association in geometry between beauty and truth – the three “ingredients” to beauty being symmetry, proportion and harmony.’ [Lucy Feagins, ‘Louise Tuckwell: Concrete Expression’, The Design Files, 8 March 2016, accessed 18 May 2020].

UNSW_TVFH_P_0020,"Drawing from her experience as a ‘third culture kid’, Chinese–Australian artist Louise Zhang reconciles her Chinese and Western identities through an interplay of cross-cultural symbolism. Using a colour palette of sugary pastels, in her painting, sculpture and installations Zhang constructs fantastical landscapes and amorphic sculptures which create simultaneous abject horror and delight. These works draw upon the visual language of Western horror cinema and Chinese mythology and culture to explore the space between the attractive and repulsive and create new forms of meaning.
